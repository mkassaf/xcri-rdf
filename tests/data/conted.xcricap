  undertake some sampling to contrast different quality stretches
  of river as Alison takes you through what constitutes a good
  profiled and quality river system.

The open fields, common lands and manorial wastes were swept away, to be replaced by small fields surrounded by hedgerows. During these two centuries over half of the county was thus affected.&#xD;
The process which brought about this change is known as enclosure. Legally enclosure means the abolition of rights of common enjoyed by tenants of a manor over some or all of the open lands in a parish, and the redistribution of the land into individual ownership. Practically, it meant the end of strip farming, of common pasture, and of rights over the waste. Physically the change was dramatic. Significant social, economic and technological changes also followed enclosure, the effects of which historians continue to debate.&#xD;
&#xD;
This practical day school will look at the process of enclosure and at the sources available for a study of the subject. It will focus on Berkshire, though it will be relevant to anyone studying enclosure in their own locality. Teaching will be through a mix of lectures and practical workshop sessions using original documents.&#xD;
