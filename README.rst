XCRI-CAP to RDF stylesheets
===========================

These stylesheets convert XCRI-CAP 1.2 into RDF/XML using appropriate
vocabularies.

You will probably want to extend and override parts of the main stylesheet
(``xcri2rdf.xsl``) in order to model locally-important concepts and provide
identifiers for your courses, presentations, and so forth.
